# DepthEstimationAnd3DMapping
 
Depth estimation using Deep Learning algorithm to map points in a 3D map.

This can be used for visual odometry.

It can then be embedded in a robot to map its environment while moving using coding wheels or/and IMU.

The project is described [here](https://apiquet.com/2021/04/09/depth-estimation-and-3d-mapping/)
