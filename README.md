# DepthEstimationAnd3DMapping

This project uses a Deep Learning algorithm for monocular depth estimation and an IMU to know the orientation of the camera.

It can be embedded in a robot to map its environment while moving.

The project is described [here](https://apiquet.com/2021/04/09/depth-estimation-and-3d-mapping/)
