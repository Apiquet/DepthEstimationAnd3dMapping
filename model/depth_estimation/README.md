# Depth estimation model

## Some research

The models were found on the kitti dataset benchmark: http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_depth.php?benchmark=depth_prediction 

* ViP-DeepLab: Learning Visual Perception with Depth-aware Video Panoptic
Segmentation

* Patchwork: A Patch-wise Attention Network for
Efficient Object Detection and Segmentation in Video Streams
